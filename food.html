                    BRIYANI
                </h2>
                <p style="flex-direction: column;">Kolkata Biryani is a famous variation of biryani that originated in
                    the
                    city
                    of Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta), located in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal. Kolkata
                    Biryani
                    is known for its distinct flavor, aroma, and texture, which sets it apart from other regional
                    variations
                    of
                    biryani.

                    Kolkata Biryani is typically made with long-grain rice, meat (usually chicken or mutton), potatoes,
                    and
                    a
                    unique blend of spices that includes bay leaves, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, and saffron. The meat
                    is
                    first
                    marinated in a blend of spices and yogurt before being cooked with the potatoes in a separate pot.
                    The
                    rice
                    is then cooked separately with the same blend of spices and is then layered with the cooked meat and
                    potatoes before being steamed together.

                    One of the distinguishing features of Kolkata Biryani is the use of potatoes, which is not commonly
                    found in
                    other variations of biryani. The addition of potatoes not only adds a unique flavor and texture to
                    the
                    dish
                    but also makes it more filling.

                    Kolkata Biryani is often served with a side of raita, which is a yogurt-based dip made with
                    cucumber,
                    mint,
                    and other spices. The dish is a popular street food in Kolkata and can be found in many local
                    restaurants
                    and food stalls.</p>

                    After frying, the langcha is then soaked in a sugar syrup that is typically flavored with
                    cardamom, saffron, or rose water. The syrup infuses the langcha with sweetness and flavor,

                <p style="flex-direction: column;">Payesh or Payasam is a popular dessert in Kolkata and other
                    parts of West Bengal. It is a type of rice pudding that is made by cooking rice in milk and
                    sweetening it with sugar.

                    To make payesh, rice is first washed and soaked in water for a few hours. The rice is then
                    drained and cooked in milk over low heat, stirring frequently to prevent the rice from
                    sticking to the bottom of the pan. As the rice cooks, it absorbs the milk and becomes tender
                    and creamy.

                    Once the rice is fully cooked, sugar is added to sweeten the pudding. Other ingredients such
                    as cardamom, saffron, or nuts can also be added for flavor and texture. The payesh is then
                    allowed to cool to room temperature before being chilled in the refrigerator.

                    Payesh is typically served chilled and garnished with chopped nuts such as almonds or
                    pistachios. It is a popular dessert in Bengali cuisine and is often served during festivals
                    and special occasions such as birthdays and weddings.
