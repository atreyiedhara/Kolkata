    <p>Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta, is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal. It is located on the east
        bank of the Hooghly River and is considered one of India's most important cities. With a population of more than
        4.5 million people, it is the third-most populous metropolitan area in India. Kolkata is an important center for
        culture and education, with numerous universities, colleges, research institutions, and cultural organizations.


        Kolkata has a long history dating back to 1690 when Job Charnock of the British East India Company established a
        trading post here. The city soon became a major hub for trade and commerce between Europe, India, and Southeast
        Asia. In 1772, Kolkata was declared the capital of British India by Warren Hastings who served as the first
        Governor General of India from 1773 to 1785. During this period, the city went through several major
        developments that included new buildings, bridges, canals, and roads.


        The 19th century saw Kolkata become a major center for industry and manufacturing in India. Textiles mills were
        set up in large numbers while there was also significant growth in mining activities such as coal mining and
        iron ore production. By 1901, it had become the second largest city in India with a population of over 1 million
        people.


        The 20th century saw Kolkata playing an important role in India’s independence movement led by Mahatma Gandhi
        and other leaders. The city also experienced considerable economic growth during this time due to its strategic
        location at the mouth of the Ganges River which allowed it to act as a gateway to eastern India. After
        independence in 1947, Kolkata continued to be an important industrial and commercial hub in India with many
        large companies setting up their headquarters here including Tata Steel, ITC Ltd., Usha Martin Group, Coal India
        Limited etc.


        Today Kolkata is often referred to as ‘the City of Joy’ due to its vibrant culture and friendly people who are
        always eager to help others out. It is home to some amazing architectural masterpieces such as Victoria Memorial
        Hall and Howrah Bridge which have become iconic symbols of the city’s rich heritage. There are numerous places
        to explore in Kolkata including historical monuments like Fort William and St John’s Church; museums such as
        Indian Museum; parks like Rabindra Sarobar; temples like Dakshineswar Kali Temple; markets like New Market; and
        eateries like Mocambo
